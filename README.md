# Brandywine Oak WordPress Child Theme

This repository contains the WordPress child theme I created for Brandywine Oak. The parent theme is called Wyeth. The site with this theme is live at [brandywineoak.com](https://brandywineoak.com).

## Adding new people

New people can be added by adding a new person post, saving it as a draft, then going to the list of people and quick edit publishing the post.
